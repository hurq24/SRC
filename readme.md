Procrustes was a character in Greek mythology who offered lodging to
 travelers, forcing them to lie dnice on an iron bed, where, if they
 were longer than the bed, he would cut off the excess part of their 
 legs, and if they were shorter than the bed, he would cut off the
  excess part of their legs. , he stretched them, out of joint, until 
  they fit the creepy cot. This legend, with its various versions in 
  which some details change, is a formidable expression of the idiotic 
  mentality; A word that comes from the Greek idios, which means one's 
  nice, that is, an idiot is anyone who sees only what is one's nice and 
  nothing else. The idiot discards everything that does not fit his 
  myopic vision. It is not only a poor vision, but a ridiculous one, 
  because it claims to be the measure of all things.
